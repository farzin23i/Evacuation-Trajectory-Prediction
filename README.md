# Evacuation-Trajectory-Prediction

This is the Reinforcement way for solving the problem of evacuation from a room throgh one door. The aim of this promlem is to capture the difference pathes which each pedestian have used. From these routs the machine can underestand the place of obstacles too. My way of compeling each player to remaine in path is to put food on it and put enemies out of them. The bigges food then is on the doors. There are also some othere enemies too: in each step, the room of each player is place of penalty for every one else. So each player should learn to refrain from others. The hesitation penalty is too defiened to enforce players to take the fastest rout, in time and distance. 

The Reinforcement ideas and base codes are from the toturials on web-page https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/ .
Thanks to them, this is a good toturial and I recomend it to you if you are willing to learn and understand the theory and conding for RL.
