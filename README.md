# Evacuation-Trajectory-Prediction

This is the Reinforcement way for solving the problem of evacuation from a room throgh one door. The aim of this problem is to capture the difference pathes which each pedestian have used. From these routs the machine can underestand the place of obstacles too. My way of compeling each player to remaine in path is to put food on it and put enemies out there. The ultimate & biggest food is on the door sites indeed. There are also some othere enemies too: in each step, the each player's site is a place of penalty/enemy for every one else. So each player should learn to avoide the others. The hesitation penalty is too defiened to enforce players to take the fastest rout, in time and distance. 

The Reinforcement ideas and base codes are from the toturials on web-page https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/ .
Thanks to them, this is a good toturial and I recomend it to you if you are willing to learn and understand the theory and conding for RL.
